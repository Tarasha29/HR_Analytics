# HR_Analytics
Analyzing HR data focused on employee attrition. The dashboard shows how different factors like salary, years worked at a company, age, and so on impact employee attrition. Several insights can be drawn from it - for example, employees who quit tend to be earning less than the average salary. These insights can help improve employee retention and increase job satisfaction.
